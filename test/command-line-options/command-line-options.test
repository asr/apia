           --atp=NAME                           Set the ATP (cvc4, e, equinox, ileancop, metis, spass, vampire or z3)
                                                (default: e, equinox and vampire)
           --check                              Check the syntax of the generated TPTP files using the
                                                tptp4X program from the TPTP library
           --dump-agdai                         Dump the Agda interface file to stdout
           --dump-qnames                        Dump Agda QNames information to stdout
           --function-constant                  Use a hard-coded binary function symbol for the translation
                                                of functions (required for handling currying)
           --help                               Show this help
  -i DIR   --include-path=DIR                   Look for imports in DIR
  -L LANG  --lang=LANG                          TPTP output language (fof or tff0)
                                                (default: fof)
           --no-internal-equality               Do not translate _â‰¡_ to the ATPs equality
           --no-predicate-constants             Do not use hard-coded (n+1)-ary predicate symbols for the
                                                translation of n-ary predicates
           --only-files                         Do not call the ATPs, only to create the TPTP files
           --output-dir=DIR                     Directory in which the TPTP files are placed (default: /tmp)
           --schematic-propositional-functions  Enable translation of universal quantified FOL propositional functions
           --schematic-propositional-symbols    Enable translation of universal quantified FOL propositional symbols
           --snapshot-dir=DIR                   Directory where is the snapshot of the TPTP files
                                                (default: snapshot)
           --snapshot-no-error                  A difference in the snapshot-test does not generate an error
                                                (implies --snapshot-test)
           --snapshot-test                      Compare the generated TPTP files against a snapshot of them
           --time=NUM                           Set timeout for the ATPs in seconds (default: 240)
           --unproven-conjecture-no-error       An unproven TPTP conjecture does not generate an error
  -v N     --verbose=N                          Set verbosity level to N
           --version                            Show version number
           --with-cvc4=PATH                     Give the path to CVC4
           --with-e=PATH                        Give the path to E
