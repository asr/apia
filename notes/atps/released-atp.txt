When there is a new release of an ATP, we should follow the following
procedure:

(See apia/notes/atps/run-atps.txt for running the ATPs)

* Test apia/notes/atps/predefined-equality.

* Test apia/notes/tptp.

* Update src/Apia/ATP.hs.

* Test all the proved conjectures and notes.

    make prove-all-theorems
    make prove-notes

* Run test-suite

    make tests

* Update README.md.

* Search for comments using the old version.

* Update the ATP in Travis, if necessary.

* Commit and push the changes.
