When there is a new release of an ATP, we should follow the following
procedure:

* In Apia, to update src/Apia/ATP.hs with the new version.

* In Apia, to test all the proved conjectures and notes.

    make prove_theorems
    make prove_notes

* In fotc/src/fot, to test all the proved conjectures if the ATP is a
  default one.

* In fotc/notes, to test all the proved conjectures if the ATP is a
  default one.

* In fotc/src/fot, to test the ATPs failures and to update the date:

    find -name 'UnprovedATP.agda'

* In fotc/notes, to test the ATPs failures and to update the date:

    find -name '*.agda' | xargs grep 'The ATPs could not'

* Test apia/notes/atps/equality/.

* Test apia/notes/tptp.

* In Apia and FOTC, to search for comments using the old version,
  i.e. something like

    find -name '*' | xargs grep -I 'old version' | sort

* In Apia, update README.md.
