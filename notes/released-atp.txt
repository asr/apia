When there is a new release of an ATP, we should follow the following
procedure:

* In agda2atp, to update src/ATP.hs with the new version.

* In agda2atp, to test all the proved conjectures if the ATP is a
  default one.

* In fotc/src/fot, to test all the proved conjectures if the ATP is a
  default one.

* In fotc/notes, to test all the proved conjectures if the ATP is a
  default one.

* In fotc/src/fot, to test the ATPs failures and to update the date:

  find -name 'UnprovedATP.agda'

* Test agda2atp/notes/atp/equality/.

* Test agda2atp/notes/tptp.

* In agda2atp and fotc, to search for comments using the old version,
  i.e. something like

  $ find -name '*' | xargs grep -I 'old version' | sort

* In agda2atp, run make agda2atp_changed.
