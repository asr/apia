When there is a new release of an ATP, we should follow the following
procedure:

* In agda2atp, to update src/ATP.hs with the new version.

* In agda2atp, to test all the proved conjectures.

* In fotc/src/fot, to test all the proved conjectures.

* In fotc/notes, to test all the proved conjectures.

* In fotc/src/fot, to test the ATPs failures and to update the date:

  find -name 'UnprovedATP.agda'

* In fotc/src/fot, to test the "Only ATP x proved the theorem" using
  something like

  find src/ -name '*.agda' | xargs grep Only

  agda2atp --atp=xxx --time=240 --unproven-conjecture-no-error file_name

* Test fotc/notes/atp/equality/

* In agda2atp and fotc, to search for comments using the old version,
  i.e. something like

  $ find -name '*' | xargs grep -I 'old version' | sort
