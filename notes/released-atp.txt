When there is a new release of an ATP, we should follow the following
procedure:

* In agda2atp, to update the documentation of src/ATP.hs with the new
  version.

* In agda2atp, to run the suite of proved conjectures with the new
  ATP.

* In fotc/src/fot, to test all the conjectures.

* In fotc/src/fot, to test the ATPs failures in FOTC/README.agda with
  the new ATP.

* In fotc/src/fot, to test the "Only ATP x proved the theorem" using
  something like

  find src/ -name '*.agda' | xargs grep '11 July 2012 : Only'

* Test fotc/notes/atp/equality/

* In agda2atp and fotc, to search for comments using the old version,
  i.e. something like

  $ find -name '*' | xargs grep -I 'old version' | sort

* To update the website.
